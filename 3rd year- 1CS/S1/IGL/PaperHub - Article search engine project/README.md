- Description: We developed a full stack Article Search engine web application that enables authenticated users to search for scientific articles using keywords. Users can filter search results by keywords, authors, institutions, and publication dates, view detailed article information, and save favorite articles. Administrators can manage moderators and upload articles in PDF format, where text is extracted and indexed using Elasticsearch. The application ensures efficient retrieval and management of scientific research, enhancing accessibility and organization for researchers.
