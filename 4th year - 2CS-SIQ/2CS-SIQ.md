# 2CS-SIQ
## List of projects:
In the SIQ specialty we have too many projects and labs during the year, which are:
  ## First semester:
  - [**RESA:**](S1/RESA/RESA.md) Advanced Networks course labs (covering internal and external dynamic routing protcols RIP OSPF BGP and more advanced concepts like MPLS, and then 4G and potentially 5G if time permits)
  - [**TPRO:**](S1/TPRO/TPRO.md) Programming theory course labs; we have 4 obligatory during the semester, it's cool and help us to explore algorithms construction paradigms and the impact of the algorithm design on the complexity of the solution.  
  - [**ANAD:**](S1/ANAD/ANAD.md) Data mining and analysis course lab; implementing multiple dimensionality reduction techniques that were taught in the course
  - [**VCL:**](S1/VCL/VCL.md) Mainly virtualisation labs (the cloud computing part is short since time doesn't permit)
  - [**SCI:**](S1/SCI/SCI.md) all IoT weekly labs

       
   ## Second semester:    
  - [**BDDA:**](S2/BDDA/BDDA.md) Optional projects but very helpful and they explore modern data science & ai horizons, ++ the bonus in CI and CF is big, so i highly recommend to take them. 
  - [**OPTIM:**](S2/OPTIM/OPTIM.md) Best module don't miss it or neglect it!! 100% practical and fun, we have labs + final big research project  
  - [**Cybersec:**](S2/SSR/SSR.md) a lot (like A LOT) of labs per week :) good luck in that for real 
  - [**SYSR:**](S2/SYSR/SYSR.md) Distributed systems lab, you have one project in the semester that last 2 months ; about implementing some distributed mutual exclusion or election algorithm that is taught in the course like suzuki kasami, RA81, RA83 etc...
  - [**ML:**](S2/ML/ML.md) Machine learning labs exploring and implementing what we have in during the lectures, the lab is divided to 2 parts, the first is about implementing the mathematical key functions from scratch like the loss function or the evaluation function and in the second part you have training results of multiple models according to the topic, and you start intrepreting them depending on your understanding of the model architecture and functioning
  - [**HPC:**](S2/HPC/HPC.md) multiple labs on various libraries + final project that cover them all 
  - [**PRJS:**](S2/PRJS/PRJS.md) projet de spécialité :)   


    Note: These are not all the courses projects, some optional modules from SIQ1 may be missing.
    good luckk <3
